To run the measurement with the program: obtain a job allocation using salloc then set the env var and use srun
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<#thread>
    srun likwid-perfctr -C N:0-<max_thread_id> -g FLOPS_DP -m ./dtrmv
where max_thread_id = #thread - 1

To run the measurement with different numbers of threads (10, 16, 32, 50, 64, 100, 128, 200, 256): obtain a job allocation using salloc then run the script
